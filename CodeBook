This Codebook explains the different variables used and any transformations applied in scripts for data cleaning project.

# run_analysis.R

## file names
- Features: List of all features
- ActivityLabelNames: Links the class labels with their activity name

###Test data
-testData: test set
-testActivityLabels: Test labels
-testSubjects: Each row identifies the subject test who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

###Train data
-trainData: train set
-trainActivityLabels: Training labels
-trainSubjects: Each row identifies the subject train who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

##new files from merging
-mergedSetData: merge the data set (train and test)
-mergedSetActivityLabels: merge the actyvity labels (train and test)
-mergedSetSubjects: merge the actyvity labels (train and test)

##New variables
-ActivityLabelName: simple and lowercase of the variable "ActivityLabelNames" from the data mergedSetActivityLabels
-mergedSubsetData: new variable from values of variable FeatureName that contains mean or standard deviation(std) without the word Freq, so ...mean()... or ...std()...
-mergedSubsetData$ActivityLabelName: Add descriptive activity label names in ActivityLabelNames to the merged sub data (mergedSubsetData)
-mergedSubsetData$SubjectID: Add descriptive ID in SubjectID to the merged sub data (mergedSubsetData)
-colnames(): Replace columns Names of the subset by Mean and Std
-mergedSubsetDataTable: the data table of mergedSubsetData
-MeanMergedSubsetData: mean and sd of the variables organize by "SubjectID", "ActivityLabelName"
-MeanMergedSubSetDataa: MeanMergedSubsetData by order of SubjectIDs
